Example 1:

Combine Two Tables
Table: Person

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| personId    | int     |
| lastName    | varchar |
| firstName   | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
personId is the primary key column for this table.
This table contains information about the ID of some persons and their first and last names.
 

Table: Address

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| addressId   | int     |
| personId    | int     |
| city        | varchar |
| state       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
addressId is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the city and state of one person with ID = PersonId.
 

Write an SQL query to report the first name, last name, city, and state of each person in the Person table. If the address of a personId is not present in the Address table, report null instead.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 



Input: 
Person table:
+----------+----------+-----------+
| personId | lastName | firstName |
+----------+----------+-----------+
| 1        | Wang     | Allen     |
| 2        | Alice    | Bob       |
+----------+----------+-----------+
Address table:
+-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
| addressId | personId | city          | state      |
+-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
| 1         | 2        | New York City | New York   |
| 2         | 3        | Leetcode      | California |
+-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
Output: 
+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
| firstName | lastName | city          | state    |
+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
| Allen     | Wang     | Null          | Null     |
| Bob       | Alice    | New York City | New York |
+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
Explanation: 
There is no address in the address table for the personId = 1 so we return null in their city and state.
addressId = 1 contains information about the address of personId = 2.



CODE-

select FirstName, LastName, City, State
from Person
left join Address
on Person.PersonId=Address.PersonId;





Example 2:

Table: Employee

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| salary      | int     |
| managerId   | int     |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of an employee, their name, salary, and the ID of their manager.
 

Write an SQL query to find the employees who earn more than their managers.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 


Input: 
Employee table:
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| id | name  | salary | managerId |

| 4  | Max   | 90000  | Null      |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
Output: 
+----------+
| Employee |
+----------+
| Joe      |
+----------+
Explanation: Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.


CODE-


SELECT Name As Employee
FROM Employee e
WHERE e.Salary >
(SELECT Salary FROM Employee WHERE Id = e.ManagerId);

Example 3:

Table: Person

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.
 

Write an SQL query to report all the duplicate emails.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 


Input: 
Person table:
+----+---------+
| id | email   |
+----+---------+

+----+------------+
| id | customerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
Output: 
+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+


CODE-

SELECT Name AS 'Customers'
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o
ON c.Id = o.CustomerId
WHERE o.CustomerId IS NULL

Example 5:

Write an SQL query to delete all the duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id. Note that you are supposed to write a DELETE statement and not a SELECT one.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.


Input: 
Person table:
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |

| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
Explanation: john@example.com is repeated two times. We keep the row with the smallest Id = 1.




CODE-

DELETE p1 FROM Person p1,
    Person p2
WHERE
    p1.Email = p2.Email AND p1.Id > p2.Id.

HARD





A company's executives are interested in seeing who earns the most money in each of the company's departments. A high earner in a department is an employee who has a salary in the top three unique salaries for that department.

Write an SQL query to find the employees who are high earners in each of the departments.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| id | name  | salary | departmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 85000  | 1            |

+------------+----------+--------+
Explanation: 
In the IT department:
- Max earns the highest unique salary
- Both Randy and Joe earn the second-highest unique salary
- Will earns the third-highest unique salary

In the Sales department:
- Henry earns the highest salary
- Sam earns the second-highest salary
- There is no third-highest salary as there are only two employees



CODE-


SELECT
    d.Name AS 'Department', e1.Name AS 'Employee', e1.Salary
FROM
    Employee e1
        JOIN
    Department d ON e1.DepartmentId = d.Id
WHERE
    3 > (SELECT
            COUNT(DISTINCT e2.Salary)
        FROM
            Employee e2
        WHERE
            e2.Salary > e1.Salary
                AND e1.DepartmentId = e2.DepartmentId
        )

Write a SQL query to find the cancellation rate of requests with unbanned users (both client and driver must not be banned) each day between "2013-10-01" and "2013-10-03". Round Cancellation Rate to two decimal points.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 2:

Input: 
Trips table:
+----+-----------+-----------+---------+---------------------+------------+
| id | client_id | driver_id | city_id | status              | request_at |
+----+-----------+-----------+---------+---------------------+------------+
| 1  | 1         | 10        | 1       | completed           | 2013-10-01 |
| 2  | 2         | 11        | 1       | cancelled_by_driver | 2013-10-01 |
| 3  | 3         | 12        | 6       | completed           | 2013-10-01 |
| 4  | 4         | 13        | 6       | cancelled_by_client | 2013-10-01 |
| 5  | 1         | 10        | 1       | completed           | 2013-10-02 |
| 6  | 2         | 11        | 6       | completed           | 2013-10-02 |
| 7  | 3         | 12        | 6       | completed           | 2013-10-02 |
| 8  | 2         | 12        | 12      | completed           | 2013-10-03 |
| 9  | 3         | 10        | 12      | completed           | 2013-10-03 |
| 10 | 4         | 13        | 12      | cancelled_by_driver | 2013-10-03 |
+----+-----------+-----------+---------+---------------------+------------+
Users table:
+----------+--------+--------+
| users_id | banned | role   |
+----------+--------+--------+
| 1        | No     | client |
| 2        | Yes    | client |
| 3        | No     | client |

| 11       | No     | driver |
| 12       | No     | driver |
| 13       | No     | driver |
+----------+--------+--------+
Output: 
+------------+-------------------+
| Day        | Cancellation Rate |
+------------+-------------------+
| 2013-10-01 | 0.33              |
| 2013-10-02 | 0.00              |
| 2013-10-03 | 0.50              |
+------------+-------------------+
Explanation: 
On 2013-10-01:
  - There were 4 requests in total, 2 of which were canceled.
  - However, the request with Id=2 was made by a banned client (User_Id=2), so it is ignored in the calculation.
  - Hence there are 3 unbanned requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 3) = 0.33
On 2013-10-02:
  - There were 3 requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  - The request with Id=6 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
  - Hence there are 2 unbanned requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (0 / 2) = 0.00
On 2013-10-03:
  - There were 3 requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
  - The request with Id=8 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
  - Hence there are 2 unbanned request in total, 1 of which were canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 2) = 0.50


CODE-




select request_at as "Day",
   round(coalesce(sum(cancels), 0)/coalesce(sum(requests), 0)/1.0, 2) as "Cancellation Rate"
from
(
    select request_at, count(*) as cancels, 0 as requests
    from trips t
    join users uc on t.client_id = uc.users_id and 'No' = uc.banned and 'client' = uc.role
    join users ud on t.driver_id = ud.users_id and 'No' = ud.banned and 'driver' = ud.role
    where t.status in ('cancelled_by_driver', 'cancelled_by_client')
        and t.request_at between '2013-10-01' and '2013-10-03'
    group by request_at
    
    union all
    
    select request_at, 0 as cancels, count(*) as requests
    from trips t
    join users uc on t.client_id = uc.users_id and 'No' = uc.banned and 'client' = uc.role
    join users ud on t.driver_id = ud.users_id and 'No' = ud.banned and 'driver' = ud.role
    where t.request_at between '2013-10-01' and '2013-10-03'
